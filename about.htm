            <p class="aboutP">Basketball is my favorite sport. I love to watch, analyze and also play it.  It hasn’t always been my sport because I started off with soccer. However, after my freshmen year of high school, I started playing it with a bunch of friends and got into it. Ever since then, I have been playing it and enjoyed it. I love watching the NBA as it has the best players in the world. My favorite team is the Chicago Bulls. It has always been them because I started watching basketball when I lived in Chicago. </p>

         <p class="secondaboutP">I enjoy playing basketball as much as watching it because it is great form of exercise. I also get a chance to meet a lot of new people through playing at my local park. I try to implement many moves that I watch from the NBA.  I believe the love for playing basketball really helps me refresh my mind due to different types of stress I go through. I try to get better at it every time I step on the court and enjoy the time spent with my friends at the same time.</p>

         <p class="thirdaboutP">I don’t watch a lot of shows because I believe it wastes a lot of time. Moreover, watching a show requires me sitting in one spot for a long period of time which I do not enjoy. However, Sherlock is probably the only show I have enjoyed the most because of it’s depth. The science of deduction is the most interesting concept and is actually realistic. Although it’s fiction, I enjoy every single aspect of the show.</p>
